Depending on the number of apps that you are spreading yourself unto, the complexity of detaching can vary from easy to quite difficult.
What are the nuances of detaching? I will enumerate some starting from the least effective to the most:

 - Set up time limits within the apps
 - Deactivate notifications
 - Use mediator apps
 - Deactivate feeds
 - Uninstall apps from your phone
 - Temporarily deactivate accounts
 - Permanently deactivate accounts - close account
